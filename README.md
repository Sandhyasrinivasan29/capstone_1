# Approach
1.To begin, use the "streamlit" Python library to build up a Streamlit application.This library has a user-friendly interface that allows users to enter a YouTube channel ID, view channel details, and also migrate.
2.Establish a connection to the YouTube API V3, which enables me to use the Google API client module for Python to collect channel and video data.
3.Migrating the channel, video, playlist,comments and other data gathered from various sources to a SQL data warehouse. MySQL can be used as a SQL database for this.
4.I created questions for user view. with the help of the SQL queries, I reterive the answers for each quesitions.
5.The retrieved data is displayed within the Streamlit application.
